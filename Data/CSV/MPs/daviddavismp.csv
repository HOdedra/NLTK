2018-01-26T15:09:33,As we prepare for talks on the Implementation Period we start from an incredibly strong position.
2018-01-26T15:05:06,As @DavidDavisMP says: participating in a customs union should not preclude us from formally negotiating — or indeed signing — trade agreements
2018-01-26T15:02:29,As @DavidDavisMP says; last year’s breakthrough in the negotiations was ‘a landmark moment of which we can be proud'
2018-01-26T15:00:49,"The aim of the implementation period is to provide certainty and continuity but it is also a bridge to a new future partnership…outside of the single market, and the customs union."
2018-01-26T14:54:46,"In the future the UK can take advantage of its status as an independent trading nation, forging its own way in the world"
2018-01-26T14:54:15,An Implementation Period allows us to grasp the benefits of Brexit by setting in place the fundamental building blocks for our country as we leave

2016-06-29T15:58:24,"(2/2) That needs vision, optimism, energy and drive – that is why I am backing @BorisJohnson for Conservative leader"
2016-06-29T15:57:43,"(1/2) The biggest issue over coming years will be managing Brexit, improving UK trade position, controlling borders and enhancing democracy"
2016-06-14T15:25:43,Mr Juncker will be visiting Britain next week - remember that this is the man who said that British “deserters” would face “consequences”.
2016-06-07T12:33:00,(5/5) Outside the EU we will be able to sign more trade deals more quickly that better suit our economy
2016-06-07T12:32:37,"(4/5) Medium sized countries like South Korea, Singapore and Switzerland are all much better at doing trade deals"
2016-06-07T12:32:03,"(3/5) Canada deal with EU has taken 9 years and may still founder. EU has no deal with China, India, US or Japan."
2016-06-07T12:30:52,"(2/5) The EU is very slow on trade deals. Took EU 6 years to reach deal with Singapore, USA just 2. S Korea deal took EU 3 years, US just 1"
2016-06-07T12:30:30,(1/5) The PM claims the EU is fast at making trade deals. This is not true.
2016-06-07T12:26:44,(2/2) The PM says “if you’re going to build a house you ask an expert”. But you wouldn’t ask experts whose house had fallen down.
2016-06-07T12:26:04,(1/2) The PM says trust the experts - the same experts who failed to spot the financial crash in 2008 and ERM in 1992?

2016-05-26T10:07:47,"(2/2) Or do we want to #VoteLeave, take back control of our destiny, and show the world how great Britain can be?"
2016-05-26T10:07:36,"(1/2) The referendum question - do we want to accept decline, as many did in ‘60s &amp; ‘70s, as part of a regional bloc with limited potential?"
2016-05-26T10:06:23,"(2/2) The reality is that hard-headed, pragmatic businessmen on the continent will do everything to ensure that trade with Britain continues"
2016-05-26T10:06:03,(1/2) Remain have claimed that our economic interaction with the continent will all but cease should we vote for #Brexit
2016-05-26T10:05:43,"The EU has been a destroyer of jobs across the continent, and has created next to no jobs for British people in the UK in recent years"
2016-05-26T10:04:30,"Greater separation from a financially unstable Europe will not give us total protection, but it will be better than being shackled"
2016-05-26T10:04:12,Huge trade imbalances in the Eurozone make it financially unstable - we end up paying for that no matter what we negotiated in the rules
2016-05-26T10:02:36,"(3/3) Those countries have the lowest unemployment, highest wages, and lower levels of inequality"
2016-05-26T10:02:24,"(2/3) It is in Norway and Switzerland - even if you take out all the FDI that is based on oil, gas and financial services"
2016-05-26T10:02:11,(1/3) A supposed advantage of the EU is more inward investment - but the highest inward investment per capita in Europe is not in the EU
2016-05-26T10:01:40,"Given how poor the EU is at negotiating deals, is it any surprise that 90% of the EU’s trade deals account for just 2% of our exports?"
2016-05-26T10:01:26,The EU’s dysfunctional trade policies make it harder for UK businesses to trade with those parts of the world that are growing fastest
2016-05-26T10:00:31,"(3/3) For the EU, trade in services is not a priority - look at how the completion of the Single Market in services has stalled for years"
2016-05-26T10:00:03,"(2/3) 90% of their trade deals include services, critical to the British economy, as opposed to only 2 out of 3 of EU deals"
2016-05-26T09:59:42,"(1/3) Singapore, Switzerland &amp; South Korea, negotiated trade deals without EU ‘clout’ &amp; have FTAs with £27 trillion-worth of countries"
2016-05-26T09:58:45,"(2/2) Chile has got deals with the biggest economies around the world - the US, China, India, Japan, Australia, Canada and South Korea"
2016-05-26T09:58:28,"(1/2) Compare the EU’s performance to that of single countries. Look at Chile, which has 1/3 of our population"
2016-05-26T09:57:52,"(2/2) And yet, the PM claims, “we sign better trade deals, and more quickly, in the EU.” This is simply not supported by the facts"
2016-05-26T09:57:33,(1/2) The EU’s track record on trade is dreadful:pic.twitter.com/Sr2yi4ds5W
2016-05-26T09:56:36,"(3/3) Two, the ability to strike new trade deals with the rest of the world, not possible in a club of 28 members"
2016-05-26T09:56:23,"(2/3) One, the ability to pursue lighter and better tailored regulation not possible under EU membership"
2016-05-26T09:56:13,"(1/3) Outside of the EU, there are two major potential benefits for the UK"
2016-05-26T09:53:26,(3/3) The truth is existing trade deals with non-EU countries would stay in place until either side wanted to renegotiate
2016-05-26T09:53:03,(2/3) There is no reason whatsoever to expect that most countries in the world would not actively want a free trade agreement with the UK
2016-05-26T09:52:44,"(1/3) Trade negotiations are exercises in mutual self-interest. They are not power plays, or coercions"
2016-05-26T09:51:04,"(3/3) France would want to protect £3bn of food and wine exports. Italy, its £1bn fashion exports. Poland its £3bn manufacturing exports"
2016-05-26T09:50:52,(2/3) Similar deals would be reached with other key EU nations
2016-05-26T09:50:43,"(1/3) Post #Brexit a UK-German deal would include free access for their cars and industrial goods, in exchange for a deal on everything else"
2016-05-26T09:50:30,"The first calling point of the UK's negotiator immediately after #Brexit will not be Brussels, it will be Berlin, to strike a deal"
2016-05-26T09:50:01,"(2/2) The EU cannot afford the threat being levelled at Britain, so called “WTO terms”, as that would involve tariffs on their exports"
2016-05-26T09:49:10,"(1/2) Germany’s economy is dependent on exports, particularly of manufacturers, and especially of cars"
2016-05-26T09:48:55,"After #Brexit, the pressures on the countries making up the EU will be different. Free trade with Britain is in all their interests"
2016-05-26T09:45:52,In the last 5 years EU membership has not increased net employment in Britain. But we have created jobs for EU citizens - around 1 million
2016-05-26T09:45:22,(3/3) The impact of EU membership has been deleterious to the poorest workers. Their job prospects and their wages have both been reduced
2016-05-26T09:45:09,(2/3) There is significant evidence from the Bank of England among others that migration pressure has depressed the lowest wages
2016-05-26T09:44:59,(1/3) Additionally 1 million of the 2.5 million jobs created in the UK economy were taken by EU migrants
2016-05-26T09:44:33,"(5/5) Job growth has come from either trade with rest of the world, or from internally driven growthpic.twitter.com/QuVavn3PPa"
2016-05-26T09:44:05,(4/5) Trade with the EU since 2010 almost certainly generated no job growth
2016-05-26T09:43:44,"(3/5) Almost all the jobs created are in sectors that have grown in line with the UK’s internal market, and trade with non-EU countries"
2016-05-26T09:43:34,"(2/5) In that same time exports to Europe have been static, whilst exports to the rest of the world have grown by £57bn, or 25%"
2016-05-26T09:43:17,(1/5) Since 2010 about 2.5 million jobs have been created in the UK
2016-05-26T09:42:48,The share of our exports going to the EU has dropped from over 60% to about 42%; this is set to fall further in the future
2016-05-26T09:41:40,(3/3) But now after 40 years in Europe we are no better off than when we startedpic.twitter.com/EvQ0Jm5Esq
2016-05-26T09:41:04,"(2/3) In 1973 we were a tottering industrial economy, and the EEC was a modern, go ahead, trade bloc"
2016-05-26T09:40:46,(1/3) When we joined the European Economic Community it was undoubtedly to our advantage
2016-05-26T09:40:22,"The Treasury forecast is not an economic forecast. It is a political forecast, with a political purpose"
2016-05-26T09:38:29,(2/2) The Treasury cannot accurately forecast 6 months. Why should we believe they can forecast 15 years?
2016-05-26T09:38:03,"(1/2) Last year the Treasury found £27bn down the back of the sofa, only to be strapped for cash by Spring"
2016-05-26T09:37:47,The Treasury and the IMF claim #Brexit will cost economic growth but neither have a good track record on forecasting
2016-05-26T09:37:17,"(3/3) Time after time the elite have got it wrong, and the ordinary people, whose wisdom was derided, have paid the price"
2016-05-26T09:37:07,"(2/3)The Gold Standard. Appeasement. The ERM. On the continent, the Euro. Globally, the 2008 Crash. And we haven’t heard from Chilcot yet..."
2016-05-26T09:36:16,(1/3) The British and international establishment do not have a great track record when it comes to the great questions of their era
2016-05-26T09:35:48,Today I want to unpick some of Remain’s arguments and expose them to factual analysis
2016-05-26T09:34:53,"The entire Remain case has been, if I may mimic @BorisJohnson, one big ‘argumentum ad verecundiam’"
2016-05-26T09:33:30,"Remain have bombarded us with scare tactics, myths of the miracles the EU brings and the disasters that will allegedly rain down if we leave"
2016-05-26T09:33:12,"In 4 weeks the British people will make the most momentous decision of modern times, remain in an increasingly dysfunctional EU, or #Brexit"
2016-05-26T08:32:44,Later this morning I will give a speech on #Brexit setting out the economic arguments for leaving. My account will live tweet from 10:30am
2016-04-27T11:00:38,"(5/5) You can read the full article, and my suggestions for how we deal with the Syrian conflict on @ConHome at:http://bit.ly/1SJJNtJ "
2016-04-27T10:59:55,(4/5) The best way of stopping the influx of jihadists and refugees into Europe from Syria is by bringing the war to an end.
2016-04-27T10:59:33,"(3/5) A consequence of this failure is 1,000 jihadists a year coming to Europe."
2016-04-27T10:58:51,(2/5) I also travelled because of my increasing concern over the failure of Western foreign and security policy in the region.
2016-04-27T10:58:34,"(1/5) Earlier this month I travelled to Syria, to witness first-hand the devastation caused by the civil war in the country."

2016-03-15T17:41:50,To watch my full contribution to today’s #IPBill debate please see:http://bit.ly/1QV58zs 
2016-03-15T16:46:27,"(2/2) Parliament must now make amendments that will put in place a law which is the safest, and highest quality framework in the world."
2016-03-15T16:45:57,"(1/2) The #IPBill as it stands grants our intelligence agencies sweeping powers, with flawed safeguards and little consideration for privacy"
2016-03-15T16:45:33,"On bulk capabilities in the #IPBill, we should be under no misapprehension as to how broad, and how potent, these powers are."
2016-03-15T16:44:58,(2/2) Inserting ‘privacy’ into a title is not a ‘strengthening’ of safeguards or a privacy ‘backbone’ as the ISC recommended.
2016-03-15T16:44:12,"(1/2) For example, the ISC called for privacy protections. The Government response? ‘General Protections’ now ‘General Privacy Protections’"
2016-03-15T16:43:21,"However, there are significant flaws with the #IPBill as it stands."
2016-03-15T16:42:55,"There is no doubt an #IPBill is necessary; as @terrorwatchdog said current law is, “incomprehensible to all but a tiny band of initiates”."
2016-03-15T16:41:52,With the #IPBill we all want to ensure that the intelligence agencies and our police forces have effective powers that will keep us safe.
2016-03-15T12:24:51,".@SteephenHaarper @chhcalling I do, and will later today be raising my concerns on the #IPBill as it stands."
2016-03-15T12:14:50,The #IPBill will have its second reading today. Parliament must use this debate to raise concerns on the Bill as it stands.
2016-03-14T17:36:18,(2/2) The Minister has now confirmed that the Government are looking into the issues raised and will report back shortly.
2016-03-14T17:35:40,(1/2) @chhcalling and I made important amendments to today’s #EnergyBill regarding noise nuisance from wind turbines.
2016-03-14T10:39:37,(3/3) Vote for Andrew Smith to win the Britain's Best Volunteer Award at: http://bit.ly/1RZisTJ 
2016-03-14T10:38:57,(2/3) Andrew and the group have also invested in a pop-up kitchen in the city centre which provides hot food and drink to those in need
2016-03-14T10:38:26,"(1/3) Great work by @hull_homeless founder Andrew Smith, who spends weekends handing out hot drinks and warm clothes to the homeless in Hull"

2016-03-02T14:18:25,.@JGForsyth see my article on @ConHome about the discrepancy between immigration and NI numbers:http://bit.ly/21CEu6G 
2016-03-02T13:24:43,You can also read my further thoughts on the immigration figures on @ConHome at:http://bit.ly/21CEu6G 
2016-03-02T13:23:24,"(2/2) If Gov fail to publish the data, people will draw the conclusion there is something to hide. The Gov should publish it immediately."
2016-03-02T13:22:52,(1/2) I asked the Prime Minister about the discrepancy between immigration figures and National Insurance figures:http://bit.ly/1nhRDiH 
2016-03-02T12:40:29,(4/4) The Government could cast light on this huge discrepancy by publishing the number of non-UK NI number holders - but refuse to do so
2016-03-02T12:23:41,"(3/4) Official figures show that 257,000 EU migrants came to the UK last year. But in the same time 630,000 registered for a NI number"
2016-03-02T12:23:15,(2/4)Biggest problem is that the @ONS figures are unreliable – hardly surprising when they are based on a survey rather than actual records
2016-03-02T12:22:40,"(1/4)The Government this week showed they’re willing to bury the true scale of immigration to the UK, with the help of some dodgy statistics"
2016-03-01T17:17:12,I discussed the #IPBill earlier this afternoon on @bbc5live. You can listen to my thoughts here: http://bit.ly/1Tl2c2M 
2016-03-01T17:16:36,.@BBCNews reports the revised #IPBill contains new checks and balances. But the judicial authorisation procedure is just a rubber stamp.
2016-03-01T17:15:07,The #IPBill – over 800 pages. Does the Government really think it is wise to rush this through Parliament?pic.twitter.com/m6AoJ4NOGL
2016-03-01T15:43:52,"(3/3) The Government now need to have a think on how Freedom of Information can be expanded and strengthened, rather than weakened"
2016-03-01T15:43:31,(2/3) It seems that the Government have finally realised that #FoI is an important and necessary part of 21st century democracy
2016-03-01T15:42:14,(1/3) Congratulations to the Government on backing off from the proposed changes to Freedom of Information
2016-02-24T11:52:00,(4/4) Do the British people really need to take lessons in job creation from companies that have singularly failed to create any?
2016-02-24T11:51:41,(3/4) There is little doubt that those 36 companies warning of consequences for UK jobs are in fact responsible for cutting jobs themselves
2016-02-24T11:51:11,"(2/4) This is all while employment across the UK has surged by 2.5 million, and despite those 36 companies making around 100 acquisitions"
2016-02-24T11:50:10,(1/4) the 36 FTSE 100 signatory companies to @thetimes letter employ barely any more people in this country than they did a decade ago
2016-02-22T17:12:48,(3/3) Moody’s claim that economic cost of Brexit would outweigh the benefits looks to be as inaccurate as we have come to expect from them
2016-02-22T17:12:19,(2/3) That is the same Moody’s which failed to predict the biggest banking crisis of modern times
2016-02-22T17:11:50,"(1/3) Moody’s have given a litany of bad predictions, today another-“a decision to leave the EU would be credit negative for the UK economy”"
2016-02-09T15:06:09,(4/4) The Intelligence and Security Committee is absolutely right to say that the inadequate #IPBill is a significant missed opportunity
2016-02-09T15:05:47,"(3/4) The report shows the #IPBill is ill-thought through, the powers granted are excessive and the safeguards are weak and inconsistent"
2016-02-09T15:05:25,(2/4) It’s clear that the Government has not given sufficient time and thought to this complex and controversial area
2016-02-09T15:05:03,(1/4) This morning the Intelligence and Security Committee published their damning report on the #IPBill
2016-02-08T14:07:37,(3/3)The failed EU immigration policy created the ‘Jungle’ camp at Calais. The idea that #Brexit would reduce border control is preposterous
2016-02-08T14:07:12,(2/3) We should spend a tiny fraction of the savings from the current EU budget contributions to enhance border controls
2016-02-08T14:06:24,(1/3) The claim that #Brexit will bring the 'Jungle' camp in Calais to southern England is simply desperate scaremongering
2016-02-04T17:47:22,Earlier today I made the case for #Brexit on the @daily_politics: http://bit.ly/1oa3lwO 
2016-02-04T17:33:40,"To see the full transcript of my #Brexit speech from earlier today, see: http://bit.ly/1VQNI8e "
2016-02-04T11:48:31,"For us, Europe has always been about trade. For the continent, it is about so much more. But the European Project is not right for us"
2016-02-04T11:47:57,"The EU history is not our history. UK has its own proud tradition of fighting tyranny, protecting liberty and democracy both home &amp; abroad."
2016-02-04T11:46:15,#Brexit is an opportunity to renew strong relationships with Commonwealth and Anglosphere countries - currently growing faster than Europe
2016-02-04T11:45:34,"We must see #Brexit as a great opportunity to refocus our economy on global, rather than regional, trade"
2016-02-04T11:41:03,(3/3) This would be a perfectly good starting point for our discussions with the Commission
2016-02-04T11:40:42,"(2/3)It eliminates all customs duties, which between EU &amp; Canada is worth €470m a year.Similar UK deal would save 5 times that on cars alone"
2016-02-04T11:40:00,"(1/3) A model for UK’s relationship with the EU, post #Brexit, is the Canadian Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement the EU just struck"
2016-02-04T11:36:09,"Outside the EU, the City would continue to be as free as it is now. But would also be free of stifling European legislation."
2016-02-04T11:35:46,The prevailing thought seems to be that the City would be damaged should we leave the EU. That is extremely unlikely.
2016-02-04T11:34:28,Access to our market is more important to Europe than our access to theirspic.twitter.com/TNzfDUBAOu
2016-02-04T11:33:47,Following #Brexit the pressure from EU companies for a free trade deal with the UK would be huge. We have far more to gain than to lose
2016-02-04T11:33:24,"(4/4) It’s not just German cars, the same would happen in industries across Europe, all demanding uninterrupted access to the UK market"
2016-02-04T11:32:44,(3/4) Within minutes of a vote for #Brexit CEO’s would be knocking down Chancellor Merkel’s door. Demanding access to the British market
2016-02-04T11:32:17,"(2/4) We are Europe’s second largest, and fastest, growing car market"
2016-02-04T11:31:53,"(1/4) To see our importance to the EU simply walk down the street and look at the BMWs, Volkswagens, Audis and the like"
2016-02-04T11:29:00,"(4/4)Our creative, financial &amp; legal industries are some of the world’s best and would certainly be included in trade deals negotiated by us"
2016-02-04T11:28:33,"(3/3) Does anyone seriously think Britain, the 5th largest economy in the World, wouldn’t be able to negotiate a better deal than the Swiss?"
2016-02-04T11:27:54,(2/3) Switzerland has a population of 8 million but is able to negotiate better trade deals for itself than the EU does on our behalf
2016-02-04T11:27:05,(1/3)Much has been made on how hard it would be for a single country to negotiate successful trade deals on its own. But look at Switzerland
2016-02-04T11:24:50,"(2/2)However, we have received far less foreign investment than either Norway or Switzerland, both outside of the EUpic.twitter.com/ToxX4kWw3U"
2016-02-04T11:24:12,(1/2) A further supposed benefit of EU membership is increased foreign direct investment in our economy
2016-02-04T11:22:19,Our membership of the single market has done remarkably little to increase trade between us and our European colleagues
2016-02-04T11:20:14,"It has long been claimed that membership of the EU increases trade among its members. That may be true for others, but not for Britain"
2016-02-04T11:19:13,"Safe course is for Britain to leave. With that in mind it is vital to set out how we leave, and what relationship we can expect afterwards"
2016-02-04T11:18:49,"#Brexit is nothing to fear. To remain a member of the EU is to constrain our future, forgo control of our destiny &amp; give up on opportunity"
2016-02-04T11:16:19,The renegotiation’s exemption from ‘ever closer union’ is not worth the paper it is written on. The ‘red card’ proposal? Even less
2016-02-04T11:15:00,"(3/3) Thirdly, the Government’s own policy of the National Living Wage will have the effect of abolishing in-work benefits"
2016-02-04T11:14:37,"(2/3)Second problem is that majority of EU migrants (75%) are only eligible for very low levels of in-work benefits, if at all"
2016-02-04T11:13:58,"(2/4)Few EU arrivals claim in-work benefits in first 4 years. In first year – 10%, jumping to around 20% by 4th yearpic.twitter.com/fTKWOmfmgU"
2016-02-04T11:13:02,(1/4) Take immigration – where the Government’s answer of an emergency brake will have no impact whatsoever. This is for 3 reasons.
2016-02-04T11:12:31,"Unfortunately, the Government has wasted the renegotiation opportunity with demands which are so unambitious as to be a waste of time"
2016-02-04T11:12:09,"The Government has four strands to its once in a generation renegotiation: economic governance, competitiveness, sovereignty and immigration"
2016-02-04T11:11:19,"Then there is the Schengen Zone, which is now crumbling before our eyes. The migration crisis is a stake in the heart of a borderless Europe"
2016-02-04T11:10:53,"The Euro is now a failed experiment, responsible for sovereign debt crises, high unemployment and trade imbalances across the EU"
2016-02-04T11:10:31,"The Euro has become a destroyer of jobs. Unemployment across the continent is running near 10%, youth unemployment double that at 20%"
2016-02-04T11:10:08,"By 2008 we had started to trade more with the rest of the World than with Europe. The fact is, Europe is becoming less and less important"
2016-02-04T11:09:35,Economic growth in the EU has ground to a halt. Since 2000 the EU has grown at 1/3 the rate of global average. The Eurozone? Even slower.
2016-02-04T11:08:02,"Last time EU expanded, less than 10 years ago, hope was Europe would become ‘wider, not deeper’. With hindsight, this now looks ridiculous"
2016-02-04T11:07:28,"The EU has been in decline for some time now. The risks of staying in? Low growth, high unemployment and waning influence"
2016-02-04T11:07:14,"It’s been over 43 years since Britain joined the EEC. Since then? Europe has become less democratic, less competitive and more dysfunctional"

2016-01-26T15:31:45,(3/3) Large companies should not be able to negotiate lower tax because they bring jobs to the UK – corner shops could not negotiate that
2016-01-26T15:31:11,"(2/3) The required change to tax law is simple – “money earned in the UK should be taxed in the UK”, regardless of where headquarters are"
2016-01-26T15:30:37,"(1/3) The tax system needs transparency, companies like Google are not the same as individual taxpayers so confidentiality is inappropriate"

2015-12-02T17:22:45,"(5/5) These actions will not destroy IS, but it will do a great deal more harm than a largely symbolic bombing mission in #Syria"
2015-12-02T17:21:51,"(4/5) Secondly, Saudi Arabia and Gulf states should stop the 10’s of millions of dollars of funding that come yearly from them"
2015-12-02T17:21:26,(3/5) Two things can be done. NATO can insist Turkey shuts its border with #Syria. Cutting the $1billion funding from IS oil sales
2015-12-02T17:20:43,(2/5) This is not a choice between action and inaction. It is a choice between inaction and distraction
2015-12-02T17:20:11,(1/5) The arguments of those saying 'doing something in #Syria is better than nothing' are false. Nobody is arguing for doing nothing
2015-12-02T17:12:05,(2/2) The limit is number of targets. The Americans get few from the rebels. We have to create a real army on the ground. #SyriaVote
2015-12-02T17:11:39,(1/2) It is debatable whether British airstrikes would have any effect. At the moment the US fly 7 sorties a day–against 140 Russian sorties
2015-12-02T17:08:12,"We are proposing to join a strategy having the opposite effect to that intended. IS recruitment now doubled from 15,000 to 30,000 personnel"
2015-12-02T17:06:03,The US air campaign aims to degrade IS. The reality is that IS are now bigger than at the beginning of the campaign
2015-12-02T17:02:21,Everyone wants to see the end of IS. Today’s #SyriaVote is about the practical method of going about it
