2016-07-07T17:44:23,Delighted that @TheresaMay2016 has the overwhelming support of Conservative MPs. 80% of local party members I saw at weekend think the same.

2016-07-01T08:41:49,Lots of Conservative MPs saying privately there must be a big role for @George_Osborne to show outside world some stability.
2016-06-30T16:44:43,Not everything here dominated by leadership issues. Spent day debating Finance Bill in committee. But then my Labour shadow resigned.

2016-06-27T17:35:44,I have more constituents writing to stop/ re-run the referendum than I had local activists for Remain (200+). A lesson there - get involved!
