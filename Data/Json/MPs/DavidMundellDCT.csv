2018-11-26T09:38:23,Some clarity here - nothing has been decided. French President's statement is an aspirational wish list. We will resist any attempt to restrict our independence as a sovereign Coastal State. Bertie Armstrong at 1.37 into GMS this morninghttps://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m00018yl …
2018-11-25T17:09:37,"The key point is that we are NOT leaving the EU with a deal on fisheries already in place. There will be a future deal on fishing to be agreed. The PM has been clear that she will defend UK fishing interests robustly in that negotiation, just as she has in the Brexit Deal 2/2"
2018-11-25T17:06:29,"The Prime Minister made clear earlier today, the UK will be an independent coastal state once again, in full sovereign control of our waters, able to decide for ourselves who we allow to fish in them, with that access not tied to any other aspect of our economic partnership 1/2"
