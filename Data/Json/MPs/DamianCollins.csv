2017-12-13T15:45:12,"5) I've met with Facebook today and again asked them for a full response to my letter sent on behalf of @CommonsCMS on 19th Oct, as part of our inquiry into fake news. This includes looking for Russian activity linked to the 2017 General Election, as well as the EU referendum."
2017-12-13T15:43:58,"4) Are we to believe that Russian backed targeting of voters through social media with fake news was limited only to Twitter during the EU referendum, when both Twitter and Facebook had been used by them in the USA during the Presidential election."
2017-12-13T15:42:27,"3) Facebook conducted research to identify 10,000s of fake pages and accounts that were active during the French Presidential election. They should do the same for the EU referendum, and not just rely on external sources referring evidence of suspicious activity back to them"
2017-12-13T15:41:01,"2) It would appear that no work has been done by Facebook to look for other fake accounts and pages that could be linked to Russian backed agencies and which were active during the EU referendum, as I requested."
2017-12-13T15:39:56,"My response to @facebook letter to @ElectoralCommUK today 1) Facebook responded only with regards to funded advertisements to audiences in the UK from the 470 accounts and pages run by the Russian based Internet Research Agency, which had been active during the US election"
